<h1>Schnitzel</h1>
A punded flat meat, we will do chicken for this recipe, breaded and served with choice of side

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
        <li>600g / 1.2 lb large chicken breasts (2 pieces,300g / 10 oz each)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (use as much as you want for flavor)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup: flour</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recpie</h2>

<ol>
        <li>Chicken breast prep: cut in half horizontally to create two steaks.</li>
        <li>Place the protein of choice on a work surface and cover with a sheet of baking paper or cling wrap. Use a rolling pin to pound to even thickness about 0.8 cm / 1/3" thick (don't pound too thin, hard to handle / might tear).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides of meat with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour in one dish, panko in another (or use a large tray for both like I did, see photos), and whisk eggs in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Coat meat in flour, shake off excess. Dip into egg, shake off excess. Press into breadcrumbs, and turn, pressing to adhere, then transfer to plate. Repeat.</li>
        <li>Heat 1.5cm / 3/5" oil in a heavy based deep skillet over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Dip the end of a schnitzel in to check if the oil is hot enough - it should sizzle straight away </li>
        <li>Carefully place 2 schnitzels in the oil and cook for 3 minutes until deep golden, turn then cook the other side for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining schnitzel. </li>
        <li>Serve with lemon wedges - I usually serve schnitzel plain like this.</li>
</ol>
